              " 'facts': \"The case involves a batch of petitions challenging the validity of notices issued under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, as it stood prior to its amendment by the Finance Act, 2021, effective April 1, 2021. The amended Section 149(1)(a) curtailed the reassessment period from 6 years to 3 years. To leverage the unamended limitation period, the Income Tax Department ('Department') generated reassessment Notices for Assessment Years (AYs) 2013-14 to 2017-18, all dated March 31, 2021, using the Income Tax Business Application ('ITBA') software. However, these notices were despatched through the ITBA's e-mail system or normal post on or after April 1, 2021. The Department contended that the date of generation of the notices on the ITBA portal (March 31, 2021) should be considered the date of 'issue', irrespective of the despatch date. The petitioners argued that the date of actual despatch (on or after April 1, 2021) should be the date of 'issue', making the notices time-barred under the amended law. The notices were categorized into five types based on factors like digital signature, despatch method, and date. The proceedings pursuant to these reassessment notices were stayed by the Court.\",\n",
              " 'issues': [\"Whether the JAO's act of generating Notice in the ITBA portal on 31st March, 2021, without despatching the Notice meets the test of the expression 'shall be issued' in Section 149 of the Act of 1961, and saves the Notices from being time barred?\",\n",
              "  'Whether \"despatch\" as per Section 13 of the Act of 2000 is sine qua non for issuance of Notice through electronic mail for the purpose of Section 149 of the Act of 1961?',\n",

              "  'Whether upload of the Section 148 Notice on the \"My Account\" of the assessee on the E-filing portal is valid transmission under the Act of 1961?'],\n",
              " 'arguments': {'petitioner': \"The petitioners contended that the expression 'issued' requires both framing of the order and taking necessary action to despatch it, meaning mere generation of a notice is insufficient without proving timely despatch. They relied on judgments asserting that a notice is issued only when it goes beyond the control of the issuing authority. They argued that there is no distinction between the Assessing Officer (AO) and the ITBA portal for Section 149 purposes, making any delay by ITBA attributable to the AO. They asserted that affixation of Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) is mandatory for e-proceedings as per CBDT notifications and that the Document Identification Number (DIN) is merely for audit trail, not issuance. They invoked Section 13 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, stating that despatch occurs when an electronic record enters a computer resource outside the originator's control. The petitioners highlighted the conspicuous absence of the 'issued on' date for the impugned notices on the E-filing portal, suggesting post-March 31, 2021, issuance. They argued that issuance is a jurisdictional requirement, placing a heavy onus on the Department to prove timely despatch. They further submitted that notices sent to unrelated email addresses or merely uploaded on the E-filing portal without real-time alerts are not validly issued.\",\n",
              "  'respondent': \"The Department argued that once a notice is generated by the Jurisdictional Assessing Officer (JAO) on the ITBA portal and a unique Document Identification Number (DIN) is assigned, the JAO loses complete control over it, thus the notice should be considered 'issued'. They contended that despatch is not a prerequisite for determining when a notice is issued. Relying on Section 13 of the IT Act, 2000, the Department submitted that the JAO is the 'originator' and the ITBA portal is a 'computer resource' outside the JAO's control, so any despatch delay by ITBA should not be attributed to the JAO. They claimed that the note appearing in the footer of notices regarding the date of digital signature has no statutory backing and that DSC affixation is not mandatory under Section 282A of the IT Act, 1961, or Rule 127A of the IT Rules. The Department argued that the words 'issue', 'forward', and 'serve' are distinct, with 'issue' preceding despatch. They also stated that the date of issue is a disputed question of fact, not suitable for writ petitions, and that service of notice is not a condition for valid issuance. They cited a Madras High Court judgment where a notice despatched on March 31, 2021, was deemed validly issued.\",\n",
              "  'ratio': \"The Court held that the expression 'issue' in Section 149 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, means that the issuing authority must, after drawing up and signing the notice, make an overt act to ensure its due despatch to the addressee. Mere generation of a notice on the ITBA portal or signing it, without actual despatch, does not constitute 'issuance'. This principle applies to both paper and electronic forms of notice, requiring despatch by post or the electronic mail leaving the ITBA servers respectively. The Court affirmed that Section 13 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, is applicable. The Department, as the 'originator', is responsible for the ITBA portal, which is its 'computer resource'. Therefore, the time taken by the ITBA's automated e-mail software system to trigger and transmit e-mails is attributable to the Department. The Court found that affixation of a Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) is not mandatory for Section 148 notices under Section 282A of the Act read with Rule 127A of the IT Rules, as long as the notice is authenticated by the name and office of the designated income-tax authority. However, uploading a Section 148 notice on the assessee's E-filing portal without a real-time alert, as stipulated for statutory validity in Section 144B(6)(ii)(a), does not constitute valid transmission. Similarly, sending notices to unrelated e-mail addresses is not due despatch. The Court emphasized that the date and time when an electronic mail message leaves the ITBA's servers is the relevant date for determining when a notice is issued electronically.\",\n",
              "  'holding': \"The Court disposed of the writ petitions with specific directions for each category of notices:\\n1.  **Category 'A' (Digitally signed on or after April 1, 2021):** These notices are held to bear the date of DSC affixation. If this date is on or after April 1, 2021, they are to be considered show-cause notices under Section 148A(b) of the Act, in line with the Supreme Court's judgment in Ashish Agarwal.\\n2.  **Category 'B' (Undated/unsigned, but sent after April 1, 2021):** These notices are deemed valid if they contain the name and office of the JAO.

              "   'text': \"26.13. Typically, an e-mail service based on SMTP Model utilizes a chain of servers to transmit\\ne-mail from the sender to the recipient. Once an e-mail is drafted and the sender presses the 'send'\\nbutton, the e-mail service i.e. the User Agent ('UA') of the sender transmits it to the Message\\nTransfer Agents ('MTAs') i.e. servers of the sender's e- mail service. Through a sequence of such\\nMTAs i.e. servers, the e- mail reaches the destination MTA i.e. server of the recipient's e-mail\\nservice. In case the recipient is using an intermediary server, it reaches the intermediary MTA i.e.\\nserver of the intermediary. It thereafter, finally reaches the recipient. In the case on hand, the\\nDepartment's e- mail service is the ITBA e-mail software system and the assessee's e- mail service is\\nG-mail, Outlook etc. The ITBA e-mail software uses dedicated servers for transmitting e-mails and\\ntherefore the e-mail is despatched when the same leaves the ITBA servers for the recipient assessee's\\ndesignated e-mail service servers.

              " 'arguments': {'petitioner': \"The petitioners contended that the expression 'issued' requires both framing of the order and taking necessary action to despatch it, meaning mere generation of a notice is insufficient without proving timely despatch. They relied on judgments asserting that a notice is issued only when it goes beyond the control of the issuing authority. They argued that there is no distinction between the Assessing Officer (AO) and the ITBA portal for Section 149 purposes, making any delay by ITBA attributable to the AO. They asserted that affixation of Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) is mandatory for e-proceedings as per CBDT notifications and that the Document Identification Number (DIN) is merely for audit trail, not issuance. They invoked Section 13 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, stating that despatch occurs when an electronic record enters a computer resource outside the originator's control. The petitioners highlighted the conspicuous absence of the 'issued on' date for the impugned notices on the E-filing portal, suggesting post-March 31, 2021, issuance. They argued that issuance is a jurisdictional requirement, placing a heavy onus on the Department to prove timely despatch. They further submitted that notices sent to unrelated email addresses or merely uploaded on the E-filing portal without real-time alerts are not validly issued.\",\n",
              "  'respondent': \"The Department argued that once a notice is generated by the Jurisdictional Assessing Officer (JAO) on the ITBA portal and a unique Document Identification Number (DIN) is assigned, the JAO loses complete control over it, thus the notice should be considered 'issued'. They contended that despatch is not a prerequisite for determining when a notice is issued. Relying on Section 13 of the IT Act, 2000, the Department submitted that the JAO is the 'originator' and the ITBA portal is a 'computer resource' outside the JAO's control, so any despatch delay by ITBA should not be attributed to the JAO. They claimed that the note appearing in the footer of notices regarding the date of digital signature has no statutory backing and that DSC affixation is not mandatory under Section 282A of the IT Act, 1961, or Rule 127A of the IT Rules. The Department argued that the words 'issue', 'forward', and 'serve' are distinct, with 'issue' preceding despatch. They also stated that the date of issue is a disputed question of fact, not suitable for writ petitions, and that service of notice is not a condition for valid issuance. They cited a Madras High Court judgment where a notice despatched on March 31, 2021, was deemed validly issued.\",\n",
              "  'ratio': \"The Court held that the expression 'issue' in Section 149 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, means that the issuing authority must, after drawing up and signing the notice, make an overt act to ensure its due despatch to the addressee. Mere generation of a notice on the ITBA portal or signing it, without actual despatch, does not constitute 'issuance'. This principle applies to both paper and electronic forms of notice, requiring despatch by post or the electronic mail leaving the ITBA servers respectively. The Court affirmed that Section 13 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, is applicable. The Department, as the 'originator', is responsible for the ITBA portal, which is its 'computer resource'. Therefore, the time taken by the ITBA's automated e-mail software system to trigger and transmit e-mails is attributable to the Department. The Court found that affixation of a Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) is not mandatory for Section 148 notices under Section 282A of the Act read with Rule 127A of the IT Rules, as long as the notice is authenticated by the name and office of the designated income-tax authority. However, uploading a Section 148 notice on the assessee's E-filing portal without a real-time alert, as stipulated for statutory validity in Section 144B(6)(ii)(a), does not constitute valid transmission. Similarly, sending notices to unrelated e-mail addresses is not due despatch. The Court emphasized that the date and time when an electronic mail message leaves the ITBA's servers is the relevant date for determining when a notice is issued electronically.\",\n",
              "  'holding': \"The Court disposed of the writ petitions with specific directions for each category of notices:\\n1.  **Category 'A' (Digitally signed on or after April 1, 2021):** These notices are held to bear the date of DSC affixation. If this date is on or after April 1, 2021, they are to be considered show-cause notices under Section 148A(b) of the Act, in line with the Supreme Court's judgment in Ashish Agarwal.\\n2.  **Category 'B' (Undated/unsigned, but sent after April 1, 2021):** These notices are deemed valid if they contain the name and office of the JAO. The JAOs are directed to verify and determine the exact date and time of their despatch from ITBA records. If despatched on or after April 1, 2021, they are to be treated as show-cause notices under Section 148A(b).\\n3.  **Category 'C' (Signed on March 31, 2021, but despatched after April 1, 2021):** The JAOs are directed to verify and determine the exact date and time of despatch from ITBA records. If despatched on or after April 1, 2021, they are to be treated as show-cause notices under Section 148A(b).\\n4.  **Category 'D' (Uploaded to E-filing portal without real-time alert):** These notices are not considered validly issued due to lack of prescribed service mode. The JAOs are directed to determine the date and time when the assessees first viewed these notices on the E-filing portal. If this date is on or after April 1, 2021, they are to be construed as show-cause notices under Section 148A(b).\\n5.  **Category 'E' (Manually despatched by speed post after April 1, 2021):** The JAOs are directed to determine the date and time when these notices were delivered to the post office for despatch. If this date is on or after April 1, 2021, they are to be construed as show-cause notices under Section 148A(b).\\n6.  **Notices sent to unrelated e-mail addresses:** The JAOs are directed to verify the date when the assessee first viewed the notice on the E-filing portal. If this date is on or after April 1, 2021, the notices are to be construed as show-cause notices under Section 148A(b).\\n\\nThe Court granted JAOs eight weeks to determine the precise date of issuance for all notices. Notices verified to have been issued between April 1, 2021, and June 30, 2021, shall be deemed issued under Section 148A of the Act and treated as show-cause notices under Section 148A(b), with the Department to follow the procedure outlined in the Ashish Agarwal judgment. Petitioners are at liberty to raise any additional defenses.\"},\n",

The amended Section 149(1)(a) curtailed the reassessment period from 6 years to 3 years. To leverage the unamended limitation period, the Income Tax Department ('Department') generated reassessment Notices for Assessment Years (AYs) 2013-14 to 2017-18, all dated March 31, 2021, using the Income Tax Business Application ('ITBA') software. However, these notices were despatched through the ITBA's e-mail system or normal post on or after April 1, 2021. The Department contended that the date of generation of the notices on the ITBA portal (March 31, 2021) should be considered the date of 'issue', irrespective of the despatch date. The petitioners argued that the date of actual despatch (on or after April 1, 2021) should be the date of 'issue', making the notices time-barred under the amended law. The notices were categorized into five types based on factors like digital signature, despatch method, and date. The proceedings pursuant to these reassessment notices were stayed by the Court.\",\n",
